# Audio Player

A simple HTML5 audio player I created for my own specific needs while learning
a new language

[Open Player](http://loganfranken.github.io/audioplayer/)

## Background

While learning Punjabi, I needed specific features out of the application I
was using to play the audio tracks. Rather than hunting around for an
application to fit the bill, I just went ahead and created my own.

## Features

Features include:

* Track navigation via left/right arrow keys
* Track stop/start with spacebar
